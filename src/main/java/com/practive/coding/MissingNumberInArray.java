/*
 * Approach: 
 * The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, 
 * i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2.
 *  Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and 
 *  subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value 
 *  of the missing element.
 *  Algorithm: 
* Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
* Create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
* Traverse the array from start to end.
* Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
* Print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum
